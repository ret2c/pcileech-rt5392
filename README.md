# PCILeech RT5392 Firmware
PCILeech firmware, masquerading as a legal Ralink RT5392 device<br>
This firmware was created for my CypherCon 8 talk: [Not Fair!!1!: Bypassing Anti-Cheat With Direct Memory Access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICKDWryepFg). It serves as a proof-of-concept into security research about DMA cheating. I am not an expert in this field, and I won't be able to provide consistent support across different constraints. I do not recommend using this firmware to cheat in (videogame).

## Features
- Shadow Configuration Space
  - Core needs to be modified, still presents as valid due to Type 0 CFG Space Header being built in IP Core prior to `EXT_CFG(_XP)_CAP_PTR` kicking in
- Writemask
- BAR Controller (Thank you [Dzul](https://github.com/dzul221/pcileech-Ralink-3090-/blob/main/src/pcileech_tlps128_bar_controller.sv) for the 3090 base)
  - Static BAR for the most part, loads EFUSE registers defined in rt2800pci driver
- Legacy INTx Interrupts (Thank you [Kilmu](https://github.com/kilmu1337/pcileech-csi2host/) for logic base)

## PCILeech Firmware Tree ðŸŒ²
List of files that have been changed from the original [pcileech-fpga](https://github.com/ufrisk/pcileech-fpga) repository.
- /ip/ Folder
  - [pcileech_cfgspace.coe](https://github.com/ret2c/pcileech-rt5392/blob/main/ip/pcileech_cfgspace.coe): Coefficient file that contains the configuration space for the firmware, allows you to mask the core to implement shadow space
  - [pcileech_cfgspace_writemask.coe](https://github.com/ret2c/pcileech-rt5392/blob/main/ip/pcileech_cfgspace_writemask.coe): Coefficient file that contains the writemask for the firmware, setting a permission map for which bits can be modified in the configuration space
- /pcie_7x/ Folder
  - [pcie_7x_0_core_top.v](https://github.com/ret2c/pcileech-rt5392/blob/main/pcie_7x/pcie_7x_0_core_top.v): Core file for defines the implementation for the PCIe endpoint interface. Includes core configuration, support for the device's capabilities (such as MSI(-x), AER, PM, DSN, etc.), clock management, and more. Since this firmware was already built from a .tcl, you can't recustomize the IP block through Vivado, you have to manually edit this file
- /src/ Folder
  - [pcileech_pcie_a7.sv](https://github.com/ret2c/pcileech-rt5392/blob/main/src/pcileech_pcie_a7.sv): Configuration file for physical PCIe signals, FIFO interfaces, etc. Main implementation is the inclusion of interrupt definitions to enable them
  - [pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv](https://github.com/ret2c/pcileech-rt5392/blob/main/src/pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv): Management for PCIe configuration space access and control, including R/W operations, device status, control registers, BAR tracking, and primarily (for our customization) interrupt functionality. Logic at the bottom is what sends an interrupt (`o_int`) through the wire
  - [pcileech_pcie_tlp_a7.sv](https://github.com/ret2c/pcileech-rt5392/blob/main/src/pcileech_pcie_tlp_a7.sv): Configuration file for TLP handling. Handles TLP processing, filtering, and routing. Main implementation is the inclusion of interrupt definitions to enable them
  - [pcileech_tlps128_bar_controller.sv](https://github.com/ret2c/pcileech-rt5392/blob/main/src/pcileech_tlps128_bar_controller.sv): PCIe BAR and PIO controller module. This file enables you to simulate behavior traits of the original donor card (RT5392 in this case). Since older Ralink chips are pretty easy to load the driver for, we only use static reads for the EFUSE logic seen in the original Linux driver code ([rt2800pci.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/net/wireless/ralink/rt2x00/rt2800pci.c) & [rt2800.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/net/wireless/ralink/rt2x00/rt2800.h)). Additionally, this file contains the logic to tell `pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv` when to trigger an interrupt by implementing a counter that ticks per clock cycle
 
Realistically, you could configure each and every file within this repository for your intended purpose (like `tlp_magic` in `/src/pcileech_fifo.sv` for DNA Lock) but it's not necessary for getting a pass on [drvscan-interrupt-info](https://github.com/Crump3tte/drvscan-interrupt-info).

## Additional Notes
- **07/23/2025**: This firmware is fully unsupported now, I will no longer be able to assist with any issues.
- **04/09/2025**: Regarding some of the issues people have opened regarding interrupts - Win10 is having a lot of issues as of late, my current recommendation is to switch over to Win11 since cloned devices aren't producing them on Win10 as expected.
- I don't have a lot of hardware to test each flavor (different cards, 75T/100T, etc.). I can only provide support for 35T cards
- I tested this FW on an older desktop with an i5 CPU, might have issues on different hardware
- Be sure you're flashing this FW correct, I only used [Kilmu's Flash Tools](https://github.com/kilmu1337/DMA-Flash-Tools/)
- IOMMU/vt-d, Secure Boot, (maybe NX-Bit), etc. etc. need to be disabled on the target PC to flash
- BME is flipped to `1` in this repo, to debug FW w/ drvscan, flip Line 222 to `rw[21] <= 0;` in `src/pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv`
- I did all of this work on a separate PC that I don't have consistent access to anymore. I'll be slow to diagnose (or even fix) some issues with this FW
- ~~If you have any problems, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/ret2c/pcileech-rt5392/issues) through GitHub~~
